Welcome to my new simple blog! I'm Daniel (as you should know) and I'll be posting here some thoughts and most likely some info on what I'm playing currently at the moment.

But I'm mostly thinking of using this as a hobby, to practice some writing, maybe some reviews of whatever I'm doing at the moment (should be mostly games).

Maybe some tech stuff from time to time. Who knows. Maybe I'll just do this one post and never again. But I think this will be a nice side hobby to have and maintain.

Cheers bros, may all the luck be with you!
