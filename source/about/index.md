Olá! (Hey!), I'm Daniel! Also known as either **ayydany** or **DanyBoss** online.

I'm a geek from Portugal the land known for Port wine and the wonderful custard tarts. It is a chill place.

## TL; DR;

- Professionally, I'd say my passion lies mostly with backend services but currently have been trying some frontend technologies, like vue.js 😄
- I'm big into healthy eating, intermittent fasting and calisthenics 💪
- My free time is mostly split by some gaming, listening to music, friends/girlfriend and visiting all sort of new places 🏓

**That's a wrap folks!**
