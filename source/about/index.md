I'm Daniel! Also known as either **ayydany** or **DanyBoss**.

I'm from Portugal the land of the old castles and a wonderful egg-tart.

## TL;DR

- On a more professional side my passion lies with Backend & integration services 😄
- On a more lifestyle side, I'm big into healthy eating, IF, and calisthenics 💪
- On a more hobby side, mostly split by some gaming, loads of music, friends and visiting all sort of new places 🏓

**That's a wrap folks!**
