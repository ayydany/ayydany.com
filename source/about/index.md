Ol√°! (Hey!) I'm Daniel!

Also known as **ayydany** or **DanyBoss** online, I'm a tech enthusiast from Portugal, the land of delicious Port wine and heavenly custard tarts (pastel de nata, anyone?). üáµüáπ

In a nutshell:

- **Backend developer**: My passion lies in building robust and scalable backend services, but I'm also exploring the exciting world of frontend technologies like *Vue.js*.
- **Health nut**: I prioritize healthy eating, intermittent fasting, and calisthenics to stay energized and focused.
- **Life enthusiast**: When I'm not coding or fueling my body, you can find me gaming, exploring new places with friends and loved ones, or enjoying good music. Ô∏è

**That's me in a nutshell!** Feel free to explore my website to learn more about my journey and connect with me.
