# Olá! (Hey!) 

I'm Daniel! Also known as either **ayydany** or **DanyBoss**.

I'm from Portugal the land of the old castles and a really good egg-tart.

## TL;DR;
On a more technical side my passion lies with Back-End & integration services 😄
On a more lifestyle side, I'm big into healthy eating, IF, and calisthenics 💪
On a more hobby side, mostly split by some gaming, loads of music, friendos and some books here and there 🏓
On a more future kind of view, I'd love to keep visiting new places and meeting new people all over the world 🌱

**Thats a wrap folks!**
