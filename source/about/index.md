Olá! (Hey!) I'm Daniel.

Most folks online know me as **ayydany**, a Portuguese engineer helping streaming platforms stay smooth with Java and Spring Boot services that hold steady across thousands of transactions every second, while polishing React and Vite tooling to keep the product experience sharp.

These days I’m deep in distributed systems work—designing resilient pipelines, observability loops, and developer workflows that support live content at scale. On the side I experiment with frontend components, build little productivity tools, and document what I learn along the way.

Away from the keyboard I'm usually chasing calisthenics goals, hopping between hidden cafés, teaming up for co-op RPGs, or swapping indie playlists with my girlfriend.

That’s me. Dive in, explore, and feel free to say hi.
